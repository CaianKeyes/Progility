Each task will contain a description, a list of requirements and the time it should take to complete. The task lists will be ordered oldest first. It will also allow the admin to track the stats of the different members of the group, seeing how many tasks they have completed and how many hours they have done. A post only displays its title in the list, but once clicked on shows all the details.",
