This app will allow an admin to create tasks that can be sent specifically to a member of the group or post it to a general list where it can be accepted by a member. Each task will contain a description, a list of requirements and the time it should take to complete. The task lists will be ordered oldest first. It will also allow the admin to track the stats of the different members of the group, seeing how many tasks they have completed and how many hours they have done. A post only displays its title in the list, but once clicked on shows all the details.

I would like the stats to be weekly, monthly and all-time and be available for the whole group and each member individually.

Extra features I would like to add if possible: urgent Tasks, Admin must verify a task before it can be completed, comments can be left when submitting tasks.
